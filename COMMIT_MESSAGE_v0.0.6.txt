fix: Use DID instead of identifier/email for post creation

The createRecord API requires the 'repo' field to be a DID (Decentralized Identifier)
or a handle, not an email address. When users authenticate with email, we were
incorrectly passing the email to the repo field, causing a 400 error:
"Input/repo must be a valid did or a handle"

Now using the DID returned from authentication (did:plc:...) which is the correct
identifier for creating posts.

This was discovered through debug logging which showed:
- Authentication: ✅ Success (got DID)
- Upload: ✅ Success (image uploaded)
- Create Post: ❌ Failed (was using email instead of DID)

Fixes #5 - Posts not appearing on Bluesky
