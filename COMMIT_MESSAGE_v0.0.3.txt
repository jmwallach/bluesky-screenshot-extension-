fix: Correct screenshot cropping to capture visible text

- Remove window.scrollX and window.scrollY from region calculation
- Use viewport coordinates directly since captureVisibleTab only captures visible area
- Fixes black screenshot issue caused by incorrect coordinate system

The problem was mixing page coordinates (with scroll offsets) with viewport
capture which only sees the visible browser window. Now coordinates match
the captured area properly.

Fixes #3 - Black screenshots
