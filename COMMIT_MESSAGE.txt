fix: Convert extension from TypeScript to plain JavaScript for compatibility

- Remove all TypeScript syntax (type assertions, non-null operators)
- Eliminate ES6 module imports that caused service worker failures
- Remove "type": "module" from manifest.json
- Inline postToBluesky functionality directly in content.js
- Add "scripting" permission for dynamic script injection
- Replace ErrorHandler imports with inline error handling
- Simplify error messages with console.error and notifications
- Fix syntax errors on lines 50, 63, and 115 of background.js
- Ensure compatibility with Manifest V3 service workers

This resolves the "Uncaught SyntaxError" and "Service worker registration failed" errors.
