fix: Add host permissions and improve restricted page handling

- Add http://*/* and https://*/* to host_permissions for reliable injection
- Check for restricted protocols (chrome:, edge:, file:, etc.) before attempting injection
- Improve error messages to guide users to valid pages
- Increase script initialization delay to 200ms for reliability
- Better logging for debugging injection issues

This fixes the "Cannot access contents of the page" error on regular websites
while providing clear feedback when trying to use on restricted pages.

Fixes #4 - Content script injection permission error
